# This is the main CI workflow that runs the test suite on all pushes to main and all pull requests.
# It runs the following jobs:
# - required: runs the test suite on ubuntu with stable and beta rust toolchains
# - minimal: runs the test suite with the minimal versions of the dependencies that satisfy the
#   requirements of this crate, and its dependencies
# - os-check: runs the test suite on mac and windows
# - coverage: runs the test suite and collects coverage information
# See check.yml for information about how the concurrency cancellation and workflow triggering works

  minimal:
    # This action chooses the oldest version of the dependencies permitted by Cargo.toml to ensure
    # that this crate is compatible with the minimal version that this crate and its dependencies
    # require. This will pickup issues where this create relies on functionality that was introduced
    # later than the actual version specified (e.g., when we choose just a major version, but a
    # method was added after this version).
    #
    # This particular check can be difficult to get to succeed as often transitive dependencies may
    # be incorrectly specified (e.g., a dependency specifies 1.0 but really requires 1.1.5). There
    # is an alternative flag available -Zdirect-minimal-versions that uses the minimal versions for
    # direct dependencies of this crate, while selecting the maximal versions for the transitive
    # dependencies. Alternatively, you can add a line in your Cargo.toml to artificially increase
    # the minimal dependency, which you do with e.g.:
    # ```toml
    # # for minimal-versions
    # [target.'cfg(any())'.dependencies]
    # openssl = { version = "0.10.55", optional = true } # needed to allow foo to build with -Zminimal-versions
    # ```
    # The optional = true is necessary in case that dependency isn't otherwise transitively required
    # by your library, and the target bit is so that this dependency edge never actually affects
    # Cargo build order. See also
    # https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini/blob/fde336472b712bc7ebf5b4e772023a7ba71b2262/Cargo.toml#L47-L49.
