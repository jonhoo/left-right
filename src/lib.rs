//! A lock-free, eventually consistent, concurrent multi-value map.
//!
//! This map implementation allows reads and writes to execute entirely in parallel, with no
//! implicit synchronization overhead. Reads never take locks on their critical path, and neither
//! do writes assuming there is a single writer (multi-writer is possible using a `Mutex`), which
//! significantly improves performance under contention.
//!
//! The trade-off exposed by this module is one of eventual consistency: writes are not visible to
//! readers except following explicit synchronization. Specifically, readers only see the
//! operations that preceeded the last call to `WriteHandle::refresh` by a writer. This lets
//! writers decide how stale they are willing to let reads get. They can refresh the map after
//! every write to emulate a regular concurrent `HashMap`, or they can refresh only occasionally to
//! reduce the synchronization overhead at the cost of stale reads.
//!
//! For read-heavy workloads, the scheme used by this module is particularly useful. Writers can
//! afford to refresh after every write, which provides up-to-date reads, and readers remain fast
//! as they do not need to ever take locks.
//!
//! The map is multi-value, meaning that every key maps to a *collection* of values. This
//! introduces some memory cost by adding a layer of indirection through a `Vec` for each value,
//! but enables more advanced use. This choice was made as it would not be possible to emulate such
//! functionality on top of the semantics of this map (think about it -- what would the operational
//! log contain?).
//!
//! To faciliate more advanced use-cases, each of the two maps also carry some customizeable
//! meta-information. The writers may update this at will, and when a refresh happens, the current
//! meta will also be made visible to readers. This could be useful, for example, to indicate what
//! time the refresh happened.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Single-reader, single-writer
//!
//! ```
//! // new will use the default HashMap hasher, and a meta of ()
//! // note that we get separate read and write handles
//! // the read handle can be cloned to have more readers
//! let (book_reviews_r, mut book_reviews_w) = evmap::new();
//!
//! // review some books.
//! book_reviews_w.insert("Adventures of Huckleberry Finn",    "My favorite book.");
//! book_reviews_w.insert("Grimms' Fairy Tales",               "Masterpiece.");
//! book_reviews_w.insert("Pride and Prejudice",               "Very enjoyable.");
//! book_reviews_w.insert("The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes", "Eye lyked it alot.");
//!
//! // at this point, reads from book_reviews_r will not see any of the reviews!
//! assert_eq!(book_reviews_r.len(), 0);
//! // we need to refresh first to make the writes visible
//! book_reviews_w.refresh();
//! assert_eq!(book_reviews_r.len(), 4);
//! // reads will now return Some() because the map has been initialized
//! assert_eq!(book_reviews_r.get("Grimms' Fairy Tales").map(|rs| rs.len()), Some(1));

//! ```
//!
//! `ReadHandle` is not `Sync` as it is not safe to share a single instance
//! amongst threads. A fresh `ReadHandle` needs to be created for each thread
//! either by cloning a `ReadHandle` or from a `ReadHandleFactory`.
//!
//! The reason for this is that each `ReadHandle` assumes that only one
//! thread operates on it at a time. For details, see the implementation
//! comments on `ReadHandle`.
//!
//!```compile_fail
//! use evmap::ReadHandle;
//!
//! fn is_sync<T: Sync>() {
//!   // dummy function just used for its parameterized type bound
//! }
//!
//! // the line below will not compile as ReadHandle does not implement Sync
//!
//! is_sync::<ReadHandle<u64, u64>>()
//!```
//!
//! `ReadHandle` **is** `Send` though, since in order to send a `ReadHandle`,
//! there must be no references to it, so no thread is operating on it.
//!
//!```
//! use evmap::ReadHandle;
//!
//! fn is_send<T: Send>() {
//!   // dummy function just used for its parameterized type bound
//! }
//!
//! is_send::<ReadHandle<u64, u64>>()
//!```
//!
//! For further explanation of `Sync` and `Send` [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/send-and-sync.html)
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! Under the hood, the map is implemented using two regular `HashMap`s, an operational log,
//! epoch counting, and some pointer magic. There is a single pointer through which all readers
//! go. It points to a `HashMap`, which the readers access in order to read data. Every time a read
//! has accessed the pointer, they increment a local epoch counter, and they update it again when
//! they have finished the read (see #3 for more information). When a write occurs, the writer
//! updates the other `HashMap` (for which there are no readers), and also stores a copy of the
//! change in a log (hence the need for `Clone` on the keys and values). When
//! `WriteHandle::refresh` is called, the writer, atomically swaps the reader pointer to point to
//! the other map. It then waits for the epochs of all current readers to change, and then replays
//! the operational log to bring the stale map up to date.
//!
//! Since the implementation uses regular `HashMap`s under the hood, table resizing is fully
//! supported. It does, however, also mean that the memory usage of this implementation is
//! approximately twice of that of a regular `HashMap`, and more if writes rarely refresh after
//! writing.
//!
//! # Value storage
//!
//! The values for each key in the map are stored in [`Values`]. Conceptually, each `Values` is a
//! _bag_ or _multiset_; it can store multiple copies of the same value. `evmap` applies some
//! cleverness in an attempt to reduce unnecessary allocations and keep the cost of operations on
//! even large value-bags small. For small bags, `Values` uses the `smallvec` crate. This avoids
//! allocation entirely for single-element bags, and uses a `Vec` if the bag is relatively small.
//! For large bags, `Values` uses the `hashbag` crate, which enables `evmap` to efficiently look up
//! and remove specific elements in the value bag. For bags larger than one element, but smaller
//! than the threshold for moving to `hashbag`, we use `smallvec` to avoid unnecessary hashing.
//! Operations such as `Fit` and `Replace` will automatically switch back to the inline storage if
//! possible. This is ideal for maps that mostly use one element per key, as it can improvate
//! memory locality with less indirection.
